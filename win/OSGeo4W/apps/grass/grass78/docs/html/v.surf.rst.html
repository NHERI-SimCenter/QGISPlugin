<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>

<em>v.surf.rst</em> program performs spatial approximation based on
<em>z-values</em> (input vector map is 3D and <b>zcolumn</b> parameter
is not given), <em>categories</em> (input vector map is 2D
and <b>zcolumn</b> parameter is not given), or <em>attributes</em>
(<b>zcolumn</b> parameter is given) of point or isoline data given in
a vector map named <b>input</b> to grid cells in the output raster
map <b>elevation</b> representing a surface.

<p>
As an option, simultaneously with approximation, topographic
parameters slope, aspect, profile curvature (measured in the direction
of the steepest slope), tangential curvature (measured in the
direction of a tangent to contour line) or mean curvature are computed
and saved as raster maps specified by the options <b>slope, aspect,
pcurv, tcurv, mcurv</b> respectively. If <b>-d</b> flag is
set, <em>v.surf.rst</em> outputs partial derivatives
f<sub>x</sub>,f<sub>y</sub>,f<sub>xx</sub>,
f<sub>yy</sub>,f<sub>xy</sub> instead of slope, aspect, profile,
tangential and mean curvatures respectively. If the input vector map
have time stamp, the program creates time stamp for all output maps.

<p>
User can either use <em><a href="r.mask.html">r.mask</a></em> to set a mask
or specify a raster map in <b>mask</b> option, which will be used
as a mask. The approximation is skipped for cells which have zero or
NULL value in mask. NULL values will be assigned to these cells in all
output raster maps. Data points are checked for identical points and
points that are closer to each other than the given <b>dmin</b> are
removed.  If sparsely digitized contours or isolines are used as
input, additional points are computed between each 2 points on a line
if the distance between them is greater than
specified <b>dmax</b>. Parameter
<b>zmult</b> allows user to rescale the values used for approximation
 (useful e.g. for transformation of
elevations given in feet to meters, so that the proper values of slopes
and curvatures can be computed).

<p>
Regularized spline with tension is used for the approximation. The
<b>tension</b> parameter tunes the character of the resulting surface
from thin plate to membrane. Smoothing parameter <b>smooth</b>
controls the deviation between the given points and the resulting
surface and it can be very effective in smoothing noisy data while
preserving the geometrical properties of the surface.  With the
smoothing parameter set to zero (<b>smooth=0</b>) the resulting
surface passes exactly through the data points (spatial interpolation
is performed). When smoothing parameter is used, it is also possible
to output a vector point map <b>deviations</b> containing deviations of the
resulting surface from the given data.

<p>
If the number of given points is greater than <b>segmax</b>, segmented
processing is used. The region is split into quadtree-based
rectangular segments, each having less than <b>segmax</b> points and
approximation is performed on each segment of the region. To ensure
smooth connection of segments the approximation function for each
segment is computed using the points in the given segment and the
points in its neighborhood which are in the rectangular window
surrounding the given segment. The number of points taken for
approximation is controlled by <b>npmin</b>, the value of which must
be larger than <b>segmax</b>.  User can choose to output vector
maps <b>treeseg</b> and <b>overwin</b> which represent the quad tree
used for segmentation and overlapping neighborhoods from which
additional points for approximation on each segment were taken.

<p>
Predictive error of surface approximation for given parameters can be
computed using the <b>-c</b> flag. A crossvalidation procedure is then
performed using the data given in the vector map <b>input</b> and the
estimated predictive errors are stored in the vector point map
<b>cvdev</b>. When using this flag, no raster output maps are computed.

Anisotropic surfaces can be interpolated by setting anisotropy
angle <b>theta</b> and scaling factor <b>scalex</b>.  The program
writes values of selected input and internally computed parameters to
the history file of raster map
<b>elevation</b>.

<p>
The user must run <em><a href="g.region.html">g.region</a></em> before
the program to set the region and resolution for approximation.

<h2><a name="notes">NOTES</a></h2>

<em>v.surf.rst</em> uses regularized spline with tension for
approximation from vector data. The module does not require input data
with topology, therefore both level1 (no topology) and level2 (with
topology) vector point data are supported.  Additional points are used
for approximation between each 2 points on a line if the distance
between them is greater than specified <b>dmax</b>. If <b>dmax</b> is
small (less than cell size) the number of added data points can be
vary large and slow down approximation significantly.  The
implementation has a segmentation procedure based on quadtrees which
enhances the efficiency for large data sets. Special color tables are
created by the program for output raster maps.

<p>
Topographic parameters are computed directly from the approximation
function so that the important relationships between these parameters
are preserved. The equations for computation of these parameters and
their interpretation is described in
<a href="http://www4.ncsu.edu/~hmitaso/gmslab/papers/hmg.rev1.ps">Mitasova and Hofierka, 1993</a>
or Neteler and Mitasova, 2004).
Slopes and aspect are computed in degrees (0-90 and 1-360 respectively).
The aspect raster map has value 0 assigned to flat areas (with slope less
than 0.1%) and to singular points with undefined aspect. Aspect points
downslope and is 90 to the North, 180 to the West, 270 to the South and
360 to the East, the values increase counterclockwise. Curvatures are positive
for convex and negative for concave areas. Singular points with undefined
curvatures have assigned zero values.

<p>
Tension and smoothing allow user to tune the surface character.
For most landscape scale applications the default values should
provide adequate results.  The program gives warning when significant
overshoots appear in the resulting surface and higher tension or
smoothing should be used.

<!--
<br>While it is possible to automate the selection of
suitable <b>tension</b> and <b>smooth</b>ing, it has not been done
yet, so here are some hints which may help to choose the proper
parameters if the results look "weird".  -->

<p>
To select parameters that will produce a surface with desired
properties, it is useful to know that the method is scale dependent
and the tension works as a rescaling parameter (high tension
&quot;increases the distances between the points&quot; and reduces the
range of impact of each point, low tension &quot;decreases the
distance&quot; and the points influence each other over longer
range). Surface with tension set too high behaves like a membrane
(rubber sheet stretched over the data points) with peak or pit
(&quot;crater&quot;) in each given point and everywhere else the
surface goes rapidly to trend. If digitized contours are used as input
data, high tension can cause artificial waves along contours. Lower
tension and higher smoothing is suggested for such a case.

<p>
Surface with <b>tension</b> set too low behaves like a stiff steel
plate and overshoots can appear in areas with rapid change of gradient
and segmentation can be visible. Increase in tension should solve the
problems.

<p>
There are two options how <b>tension</b> can be applied in relation
to <b>dnorm</b> (dnorm rescales the coordinates depending on the
average data density so that the size of segments
with <b>segmax=</b>40 points is around 1 - this ensures the numerical
stability of the computation):

<ol>
  <li>Default: the given <b>tension</b> is applied to normalized data
    (<em>x/dnorm</em>), that means that the distances are multiplied
    (rescaled) by <em>tension/dnorm</em>. If density of points is
    changed, e.g., by using higher <b>dmin</b>, the <b>dnorm</b>
    changes and <b>tension</b> needs to be changed too to get the same
    result.  Because the <b>tension</b> is applied to normalized data
    its suitable value is usually within the 10-100 range and does not
    depend on the actual scale (distances) of the original data (which
    can be km for regional applications or cm for field
    experiments).</li>
  <li>Flag<b>-t</b>: The given <b>tension</b> is applied to
    un-normalized data (rescaled <em>tension = tension*dnorm/1000</em>
    is applied to normalized data (<em>x/dnorm</em>) and
    therefore <b>dnorm</b> cancels out) so here <b>tension</b> truly
    works as a rescaling parameter.  For regional applications with
    distances between points in km the suitable tension can be 500 or
    higher, for detailed field scale analysis it can be 0.1. To help
    select how much the data need to be rescaled the program
    writes <b>dnorm</b> and rescaled tension
    <em>fi=tension*dnorm/1000</em> at the beginning of the program
    run. This rescaled <b>tension</b> should be around 20-30. If it is
    lower or higher, the given <b>tension</b> parameter should be
    changed accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The default is a recommended choice, however for the applications
where the user needs to change density of data and preserve the
approximation character the <b>-t</b> flag can be helpful.

<p>
Anisotropic data (e.g. geologic phenomena) can be interpolated
using <b>theta</b> and <b>scalex</b> defining orientation and ratio of
the perpendicular axes put on the longest/shortest side of the
feature, respectively. <b>Theta</b> is measured in degrees from East,
counterclockwise. <b>Scalex</b> is a ratio of axes sizes.
Setting <b>scalex</b> in the range 0-1, results in a pattern prolonged
in the direction defined by <b>theta</b>. <b>Scalex</b> value 0.5
means that modeled feature is approximately 2 times longer in the
direction of <b>theta</b> than in the perpendicular direction.
<b>Scalex</b> value 2 means that axes ratio is reverse resulting in a
pattern perpendicular to the previous example. Please note that
anisotropy option has not been extensively tested and may include bugs
(for example, topographic parameters may not be computed correctly) -
if there are problems, please report to GRASS bugtracker (accessible
from <a href="https://grass.osgeo.org/">https://grass.osgeo.org/</a>).<br>

<!--
<p>The program gives warning when significant overshoots appear and higher
tension should be used. However, with tension too high the resulting surface
changes its behavior to membrane (rubber sheet stretched over the data
points resulting in a peak or pit in each given point and everywhere else
the surface goes rapidly to trend). Also smoothing can be used to reduce
the overshoots.
-->

<p>
For data with values changing over several magnitudes (sometimes the
concentration or density data) it is suggested to interpolate the log
of the values rather than the original ones.

<p>
<em>v.surf.rst</em> checks the numerical stability of the algorithm by
computing the values in given points, and prints the root mean square
deviation (rms) found into the history file of raster
map <b>elevation</b>. For computation with smoothing set to 0, rms
should be 0. Significant increase in <b>tension</b> is suggested if
the rms is unexpectedly high for this case. With smoothing parameter
greater than zero the surface will not pass exactly through the data
points and the higher the parameter the closer the surface will be to
the trend. The rms then represents a measure of smoothing effect on
data. More detailed analysis of smoothing effects can be performed
using the output deviations option.

<p>
<em>v.surf.rst</em> also writes the values of parameters used in
computation into the comment part of history file <b>elevation</b> as
well as the following values which help to evaluate the results and
choose the suitable parameters: minimum and maximum z values in the
data file (zmin_data, zmax_data) and in the interpolated raster map
(zmin_int, zmax_int), rescaling parameter used for normalization
(dnorm), which influences the tension.

<p>
If visible connection of segments appears, the program should be rerun
with higher <b>npmin</b> to get more points from the neighborhood of
given segment and/or with higher tension.

<p>
When the number of points in a vector map is not too large (less than
800), the user can skip segmentation by setting <b>segmax</b> to the
number of data points or <b>segmax=700</b>.

<p>
<em>v.surf.rst</em> gives warning when user wants to interpolate
outside the rectangle given by minimum and maximum coordinates in the
vector map, zoom into the area where the given data are is suggested
in this case.

<p>
When a <b>mask</b> is used, the program takes all points in the given
region for approximation, including those in the area which is masked
out, to ensure proper approximation along the border of the mask. It
therefore does not mask out the data points, if this is desirable, it
must be done outside <em>v.surf.rst</em>.

<h3><a name="cross-validation-procedure">Cross validation procedure</a></h3>

<p>
The &quot;optimal&quot; approximation parameters for given data can be
found using a cross-validation (CV) procedure (<b>-c</b> flag).  The
CV procedure is based on removing one input data point at a time,
performing the approximation for the location of the removed point
using the remaining data points and calculating the difference between
the actual and approximated value for the removed data point. The
procedure is repeated until every data point has been, in turn,
removed. This form of CV is also known as the
&quot;leave-one-out&quot; or &quot;jack-knife&quot; method (Hofierka
et al., 2002; Hofierka, 2005). The differences (residuals) are then
stored in the <b>cvdev</b> output vector map. Please note that during
the CV procedure no other output maps can be set, the approximation is
performed only for locations defined by input data.  To find
&quot;optimal parameters&quot;, the CV procedure must be iteratively
performed for all reasonable combinations of the approximation
parameters with small incremental steps (e.g. tension, smoothing) in
order to find a combination with minimal statistical error (also
called predictive error) defined by root mean squared error (RMSE),
mean absolute error (MAE) or other error characteristics.  A script
with loops for tested RST parameters can do the job, necessary
statistics can be calculated using
e.g. <em><a href="v.univar.html">v.univar</a></em>. It should be noted
that crossvalidation is a time-consuming procedure, usually reasonable
for up to several thousands of points. For larger data sets, CV should
be applied to a representative subset of the data. The
cross-validation procedure works well only for well-sampled phenomena
and when minimizing the predictive error is the goal.  The parameters
found by minimizing the predictive (CV) error may not not be the best
for for poorly sampled phenomena (result could be strongly smoothed
with lost details and fluctuations) or when significant noise is
present that needs to be smoothed out.

<h2><a name="example">EXAMPLE</a></h2>

<h3><a name="setting-for-lidar-point-cloud">Setting for lidar point cloud</a></h3>

Lidar point clouds as well as UAS SfM-based (phodar) point clouds tend
to be dense in relation to the desired raster resolution and thus a
different set of parameters is more advantageous, e.g. in comparison to
a typical temperature data interpolation.

<div class="code"><pre>
v.surf.rst input=points elevation=elevation npmin=100
</pre></div>

<h3><a name="usage-of-the-where-parameter">Usage of the where parameter</a></h3>

Using the <b>where</b> parameter, the interpolation can be limited to
use only a subset of the input vectors.

<p>
North Carolina example (we simulate randomly distributed elevation
measures which we interpolate to a gap-free elevation surface):

<div class="code"><pre>
g.region raster=elevation -p
# random elevation extraction of 500 samplings
r.random elevation vector_output=elevrand n=500
v.info -c elevrand
v.db.select elevrand

# interpolation based on all points
v.surf.rst elevrand zcol=value elevation=elev_full
# apply the color table of the original raster map
r.colors elev_full raster=elevation
d.rast elev_full
d.vect elevrand

# interpolation based on subset of points (only those over 1300m/asl)
v.surf.rst elevrand zcol=value elevation=elev_partial where="value > 1300"
r.colors elev_partial raster=elevation
d.rast elev_partial
d.vect elevrand where="value > 1300"
</pre></div>
