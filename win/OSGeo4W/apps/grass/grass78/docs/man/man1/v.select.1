.PP
Supported operators (without GEOS; using GRASS\(cq own algorithm):
.RS 4n
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBoverlap\fR \- features partially or completely overlap (GEOS equivalent: intersects)
.RE
Supported operators (internally using
GEOS \- Geometry Engine, Open Source):

\fBequals\fR \- features are spatially equals
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBdisjoint\fR \- features do not spatially intersect
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBintersects\fR \- features spatially intersect (equivalent to native \(cqoverlap\(cq)
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBtouches\fR \- features spatially touches
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBcrosses\fR \- features spatially crosses
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBwithin\fR \- feature A is completely inside feature B
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBcontains\fR \- feature B is completely inside feature A
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBoverlaps\fR \- features spatially overlap
.IP \(bu 4n
\fBrelate\fR \- feature A is spatially related to feature B
.RE
.SH NOTES
Only features with category numbers will be considered. If required
the \fIv.category\fR module can be
used to add them. Typically boundaries do not need to be given a
category number, as an area\(cqs attributes are inherited from the
centroid. Typically points, lines, and centroids will always want to
have a cat number. E.g. take a road which separates two farms. It is
ambiguous as to which farm an attribute that is attached to the road
belongs to. The boundary only needs a cat number if it will hold its
own attributes, such as road name or pavement form. A centroid in each
paddock holds the information with respect to ownership, area, etc.

.SS RELATE feature A is spatially related to feature B (using GEOS)
This operator additionally requires the \fBrelate\fR parameter (in other
GIS called \(cqST_Relate\(cq).
This operator allows calculating the
Dimensionally Extended nine\-Intersection Model (DE\-9IM).
In the following one example: Select polygon with \(cqTOUCHES\(cq operator
(North Carolina sample dataset):
.br
.nf
\fC
d.vect map=zipcodes_wake fill_color=0:128:0
d.vect map=zipcodeID35 fill_color=85:130:176
v.select ainput=zipcodeID35 binput=zipcodes_wake \(rs
         output=v_select_TOUCHES_relate operator=relate relate=\(cqT********\(cq
d.vect map=v_select_TOUCHES
\fR
.fi
The result of relate=\(cqT********\(cq is the same as seen
above in the example \(cqTOUCHES\(cq.
See the DE\-9IM page
for related operators and their definition.
