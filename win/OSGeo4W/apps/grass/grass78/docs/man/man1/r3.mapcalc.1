.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIr3.mapcalc\fR performs arithmetic on raster map layers.
New raster map layers can be created which are arithmetic expressions
involving existing raster map layers, integer or floating point constants,
and functions.
.SS Program use
\fIr3.mapcalc\fR expression have the form:
.PP
\fBresult =\fR\fI expression\fR
.PP
where \fIresult\fR is the name of a raster map layer
to contain the result of the calculation and
\fBexpression\fR is any legal arithmetic expression involving existing
raster map layers (except \fIresult\fR itself), integer or floating point constants,
and functions known to the calculator.
Parentheses are allowed in the expression and may be nested to any depth.
\fIresult\fR will be created in the user\(cqs current mapset.
.PP
As \fBexpression=\fR is the first option, it is the default. This
means that passing an expression on the command line is possible
as long as the expression is quoted and a space is included before the
first \fI=\fR sign.
Example (\(cqfoo\(cq is the resulting map):
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(dqfoo = 1\(dq
\fR
.fi
or:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(cqfoo = 1\(cq
\fR
.fi
An unquoted expression (i.e. split over multiple arguments) won\(cqt
work, nor will omitting the space before the = sign:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(cqfoo=1\(cq
Sorry, <foo> is not a valid parameter
\fR
.fi
If no options are given, it manufactures \(dqfile=\-\(dq (which reads from
stdin), so you can continue to use e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc < file
\fR
.fi
or:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc <<EOF
foo = 1
EOF
\fR
.fi
But unless you need compatibility with previous versions, use file=
explicitly, e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc file=file
\fR
.fi
or:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc file=\- <<EOF
foo = 1
EOF
\fR
.fi
.PP
The formula entered to \fIr3.mapcalc\fR by the user is recorded both in the
\fIresult\fR map title (which appears in the category file for \fIresult\fR)
and in the history file for \fIresult\fR.
.PP
Some characters have special meaning to the command shell. If the user
is entering input to \fIr3.mapcalc\fR on the command line, expressions
should be enclosed within single quotes.  See NOTES, below.
.SS Operators and order of precedence
The following operators are supported:

.fi
(modulus is the remainder upon division)
.PP
[1] The &&& and ||| operators handle null values differently to other
operators. See the section entitled \fBNULL support\fR below for more
details.
.PP
The operators are applied from left to right, with those of higher precedence
applied before those with lower precedence.
Division by 0 and modulus by 0 are acceptable and give a NULL result.
The logical operators give a 1 result if the comparison is true, 0 otherwise.
.PP
.PP
.SS 3D Grid names
Anything in the expression which is not a number, operator, or function name
is taken to be a 3D grid name.
Examples:
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
volume
x3
3d.his
\fR
.fi
.PP
Most GRASS raster map layers and 3D grids meet this naming convention.
However, if a 3D grid has a name which conflicts with the above rule, it
should be quoted. For example, the expression
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
x = a\-b
\fR
.fi
.PP
would be interpreted as:  x equals a minus b, whereas
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
x = \(dqa\-b\(dq
\fR
.fi
.PP
would be interpreted as:  x equals the 3D grid named \fIa\-b\fR
.PP
Also
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
x = 3107
\fR
.fi
.PP
would create \fIx\fR filled with the number 3107, while
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
x = \(dq3107\(dq
\fR
.fi
.PP
would copy the 3D grid \fI3107\fR to the 3D grid \fIx\fR.
.PP
Quotes are not required unless the 3D grid names look like numbers or
contain operators, OR unless the program is run non\-interactively. Examples
given here assume the program is run interactively. See NOTES, below.
.PP
\fIr3.mapcalc\fR will look for the 3D grids according to the user\(cqs
current mapset search path. It is possible to override the search path
and specify the mapset from which to select the 3D grid. This is done by
specifying the 3D grid name in the form:
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
name@mapset
\fR
.fi
.PP
For example, the following is a legal expression:
.PP
.br
.nf
\fC
result = x@PERMANENT / y@SOILS
\fR
.fi
.PP
The mapset specified does not have to be in the mapset search path.
(This method of overriding the mapset search path is common to all
GRASS commands, not just \fIr3.mapcalc\fR.)
.PP
.SS The neighborhood modifier
3D grids are data base files stored in voxel format, i.e., three\-dimensional
matrices of float/double values. In \fIr3.mapcalc\fR, 3D grids may be
followed by a \fIneighborhood\fR modifier that specifies a relative offset
from the current cell being evaluated. The format is
\fImap[r,c,d]\fR,
where \fIr\fR is the row offset, \fIc\fR is the column offset and \fId\fR
is the depth offset. For example, \fImap[1,2,3]\fR refers to the cell
one row below, two columns to the right and 3 levels below of the current
cell, \fImap[\-3,\-2,\-1]\fR refers to the cell three rows above, two columns
to the left and one level below of the current cell, and \fImap[0,1,0]\fR
refers to the cell one column to the right of the current cell. This syntax
permits the development of neighborhood\-type filters within a single 3D
grid or across multiple 3D grids.
.SS Functions
The functions currently supported are listed in the table below.
The type of the result is indicated in the last column.
\fIF\fR means that the functions always results in a floating point value,
\fII\fR means that the function gives an integer result, and
\fI*\fR indicates that the result is float if any of the arguments to the
function are floating point values and integer if all arguments are integer.

.SS Floating point values in the expression
Floating point numbers are allowed in the expression. A floating point
number is a number which contains a decimal point:
.br
.nf
\fC
    2.3   12.0   12.   .81
\fR
.fi
Floating point values in the expression are handled in a special way.
With arithmetic and logical operators, if either operand is float,
the other is converted to float and the result of the operation is float.
This means, in particular that division of integers results in a
(truncated) integer, while division of floats results in an accurate
floating point value.  With functions of type * (see table above),
the result is float if any argument is float, integer otherwise.
.PP
Note: If you calculate with integer numbers, the resulting map will
be integer. If you want to get a float result, add the decimal point
to integer number(s).
.PP
If you want floating point division, at least one of the arguments has
to be a floating point value. Multiplying one of them by 1.0 will
produce a floating\-point result, as will using float():

NULL support: Please note that any math performed with NULL cells always
results in a NULL value for these cells. If you want to replace a NULL cell
on\-the\-fly, use the isnull() test function in a if\-statement.
.PP
Example: The users wants the NULL\-valued cells to be treated like zeros. To
add maps A and B (where B contains NULLs) to get a map C the user can use a
construction like:
.PP
.br
.nf

\fBNULL and conditions:\fR
.PP
For the one argument form:

if(x) = 0		if x = 0
if(x) = 1		otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).

For the two argument form:

if(x,a) = 0		if x = 0
if(x,a) = a		otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).

.PP
For the three argument form:

.nf
\fC

if(x,a,b) = b		if x = 0
if(x,a,b) = a		otherwise (i.e. x is neither NULL nor 0).

if(x,a,b,c) = a		if x > 0
if(x,a,b,c) = b		if x = 0
if(x,a,b,c) = c		if x < 0
\fR
.fi
More generally, all operators and most functions return NULL if *any*
of their arguments are NULL.
.br
The functions if(), isnull() and eval() are exceptions.
.br
The function isnull() returns 1 if its argument is NULL and 0 otherwise.
If the user wants the opposite, the ! operator, e.g. \(dq!isnull(x)\(dq must be
used.
.PP
All forms of if() return NULL if the first argument is NULL. The 2, 3
and 4 argument forms of if() return NULL if the \(dqselected\(dq argument is
NULL, e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
if(0,a,b) = b	regardless of whether a is NULL
if(1,a,b) = a	regardless of whether b is NULL
\fR
.fi
eval() always returns its last argument, so it only returns NULL if
the last argument is NULL.
.PP
\fBNote\fR: The user cannot test for NULL using the == operator, as that
returns NULL if either or both arguments are NULL, i.e. if x and y are
both NULL, then \(dqx == y\(dq and \(dqx != y\(dq are both NULL rather than 1 and
0 respectively.
.br
The behaviour makes sense if the user considers NULL as representing an
unknown quantity. E.g. if x and y are both unknown, then the values of
\(dqx == y\(dq and \(dqx != y\(dq are also unknown; if they both have unknown
values, the user doesn\(cqt know whether or not they both have the same value.

These include, among others:
.br
.nf
\fC
* ( ) > & |
\fR
.fi
.PP
It is advisable to put single quotes around the expression; e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
\(cqresult = volume * 2\(cq
\fR
.fi
Without the quotes, the *, which has special meaning to the UNIX shell,
would be altered and \fIr3.mapcalc\fR would see something other than the *.
.SS Multiple computations
.PP
In general, it\(cqs preferable to do as much as possible in each
r3.mapcalc command using multi\-line input.
.SS Backwards compatibility
For the backwards compatibility with GRASS 6,
if no options are given, it manufactures file=\- (which reads from
stdin), so you can continue to use e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc < file
\fR
.fi
or:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc <<EOF
foo = 1
EOF
\fR
.fi
But unless you need compatibility with previous GRASS GIS versions, use file=
explicitly, as stated above.
.PP
When the map name contains uppercase letter(s) or a dot which are not
allowed to be in module option names, the \fIr3.mapcalc\fR command will
be valid also without quotes:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc volume_A=1
r3.mapcalc volume.1=1
\fR
.fi
However, this syntax is not recommended as quotes as stated above more safe.
Using quotes is both backwards compatible and valid in future.
.SS Interactive input in command line
For formulas that the user enters from standard input
(rather than from the command line), a line continuation feature now exists.
If the user adds a backslash to the end of an input line, \fIr3.mapcalc\fR assumes that
the formula being entered by the user continues on to the next input line.
There is no limit to the possible number of input lines
or to the length of a formula.
.PP
If the \fIr3.mapcalc\fR formula entered by the user is very long,
the map title will contain only some of it, but most (if not all) of
the formula will be placed into the history file for the \fIresult\fR map.
.PP
When the user enters input to \fIr3.mapcalc\fR non\-interactively on
the command line, the program will not warn the user not to overwrite
existing map layers.  Users should therefore take care to assign program
outputs raster map names that do not yet exist in their current mapsets.
.SS 3D GRID MASK handling
.PP
\fIr3.mapcalc\fR follows the common GRASS behavior of raster MASK handling,
so the MASK is only applied when reading an existing GRASS raster map.
This implies that, for example, the command:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(dqvolume_amplified = volume * 3\(dq
\fR
.fi
create a map respecting the masked pixels if MASK is active.
.PP
However, when creating a map which is not based on any map,
e.g. a map from a constant:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(dqvolume_const = 200.0\(dq
\fR
.fi
the created raster map is limited only by a computation region
but it is not affected by an active MASK.
This is expected because, as mentioned above, MASK is only applied when reading,
not when writing a raster map.
.PP
If also in this case the MASK should be applied, an if() statement including the
MASK should be used, e.g.:
.br
.nf
\fC
r3.mapcalc \(dqvolume_const = if(MASK, 200.0, null())\(dq
\fR
.fi
When testing MASK related expressions keep in mind that when MASK is active
you don\(cqt see data in masked areas even if they are not NULL.
See \fIr.mask\fR for details.
.SS Random number generator initialization
.PP
The pseudo\-random number generator used by the rand() function can
be initialised to a specific value using the \fBseed\fR option.
This can be used to replicate a previous calculation.
.PP
Alternatively, it can be initialised from the system time and the
PID using the \fB\-r\fR flag. This should result in a different seed
being used each time.
.PP
In either case, the seed will be written to the map\(cqs history, and
can be seen using \fIr.info\fR.
.PP
If you want other people to be able to verify your results, it\(cqs
preferable to use the \fBseed\fR option to supply a seed which is
either specified in the script or generated from a determenistic process
such as a pseudo\-random number generator given an explicit seed.
.PP
Note that the rand() function will generate a fatal error if neither
the \fBseed\fR option nor the \fB\-s\fR flag are given.
.SH EXAMPLES
To compute the average of two 3D grids
\fIa\fR and \fIb\fR:
.br
.nf
\fC
ave = (a + b)/2
\fR
.fi
To form a weighted average:
.br
.nf
\fC
ave = (5*a + 3*b)/8.0
\fR
.fi
To produce a binary representation of 3D grid
\fIa\fR so that category 0 remains 0 and all other categories become 1:
.br
.nf
\fC
mask = a != 0
\fR
.fi
This could also be accomplished by:
.br
.nf
\fC
mask = if(a)
\fR
.fi
To mask 3D grid \fIb\fR by 3D grid \fIa\fR:
.br
.nf
\fC
result = if(a,b)
\fR
.fi
To change all values below 5 to NULL, keep otherwise:
.br
.nf
\fC
newmap = if(map < 5, null(), map)
\fR
.fi
The graph() function allows users to specify a x\-y conversion using
pairs of x,y coordinates.
In some situations a transformation from one value to another is not
easily established mathematically, but can be represented by a 2\-D
graph and then linearly interpolated. The graph() function provides
the opportunity to accomplish this.
An x\-axis value is provided to the graph function along with
the associated graph represented by a series of x,y pairs.  The x
values must be monotonically increasing (each larger than or equal to
the previous).  The graph function linearly interpolates between
pairs.  Any x value lower the lowest x value (i.e. first) will have
the associated y value returned.  Any x value higher than the last
will similarly have the associated y value returned.  Consider the
request:
.br
.nf
\fC
newmap = graph(map, 1,10, 2,25, 3,50)
\fR
.fi
X (map) values supplied and y (newmap) values returned:
.br
.nf
\fC
0, 10
1, 10
1.5, 17.5
2.9, 47.5
4, 50
100, 50
\fR
.fi
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
The \fIresult\fR variable on the left hand side of the equation should not
appear in the \fIexpression\fR on the right hand side.
.br
.nf
\fC
mymap = if( mymap > 0, mymap, 0)
\fR
.fi
.PP
Any maps generated by a \fIr3.mapcalc\fR command only exist after the entire
command has completed. All maps are generated concurrently, row\-by\-row
(i.e. there is an implicit \(dqfor row in rows {...}\(dq around the entire expression).
Thus the #, @, and [ ] operators cannot be used on a map
generated within same \fIr3.mapcalc\fR command run.
.br
.nf
\fC
newmap = oldmap * 3.14
othermap = newmap[\-1, 0] / newmap[1, 0]
\fR
.fi
.PP
Continuation lines must end with a \(rs and have \fIno\fR trailing
white space (blanks or tabs). If the user does leave white space at the end of
continuation lines, the error messages produced by \fIr3.mapcalc\fR will
be meaningless and the equation will not work as the user intended.
This is particularly important for the eval() function.
.PP
Currently, there is no comment mechanism in \fIr3.mapcalc\fR.
Perhaps adding a capability that would cause the entire line to be
ignored when the user inserted a # at the start of a line
as if it were not present, would do the trick.
.PP
The function should require the user to type \(dqend\(dq or \(dqexit\(dq instead
of simply a blank line. This would make separation of multiple scripts
separable by white space.
.PP
\fIr3.mapcalc\fR does not print a warning in case of operations on
NULL cells. It is left to the user to utilize the isnull() function.
